# Student Depression Analysis (R)
This mini project was completed as a self-directed mini-study to practice R and statistical analysis on a public mental-health dataset.
I used this project to strengthen my quantitative skills as a psychology undergraduate interested in clinical and mental health research.
Key finding: 52.9% vs 25.4%; χ²(1)=6.40, p=.011; OR=3.31, 95% CI [1.40, 8.03].
